a) see graph_a01.png

b) addition with floating point takes 3 cycles

c) integer multiplication is restringing to 3 cycles

d) the operations can be staggered so they are at dif


2.

a) CPE >= 2.00 because of hardware limitations. The ALU gets backlogged with doing the addition for the operation and increasing index.


3.

a) CPE >= 2.00 still due to the ALU only being able to do two operations per cycle.

4.

I have been unable to get the count to work.
